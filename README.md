# LT-DE
Language learning application

This application is created specifically for me. You have three classes here: Main, Lt and De. You need to use them together. 

When application is launched at first, it tells hi to you.
The you need to type in which one language level you want to practice: A1, A2 or B1
Now the next action - your are choosing from three options: printing out the vocabulary, practice from German to Lithuanian or opposite.
And if you typed in second or thrid option, you have to type in how many words you are going to practice.
After taking a quiz you are getting your grade and vocabulary list which you have to revise for the next time :)

NOTE: this application does not include all of the words for a certain level. This vocabulary is only for me with the word list which I wanted to learn.
