# LT-DE
Language learning application

This application is created specifically for me. You have three classes here: Main, Lt and De. You need to use them together. 

When application is launched at firstly it says "hi" to you.
Then you need to type in which language level you want to practice: A1, A2 or B1.
Now the next step you can choose from three options: printing out the vocabulary, practice from German to Lithuanian or opposite.
Additionally, if you select the second or the third option, you have to type in how many words you are going to practice.
After taking a quiz you get your grade and vocabulary list which you have to revise for the next time :)

NOTE: this application does not include all of the words for a certain level. This vocabulary is only for me with the word list which I wanted to learn.
